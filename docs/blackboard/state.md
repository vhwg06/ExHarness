# Outer Blackboard

Status: **DERIVED ROUTING PROJECTION**

> Generated from `docs/blackboard/work-graph.json` and `docs/blackboard/component-registry.json`. Routing facts are derived; edit the canonical graph/catalog, not this projection.

## Dependency graph

```text
BB-048 [DONE] <- ROOT
BB-052 [READY] <- BB-048
BB-053 [BLOCKED_BY BB-052] <- BB-052
BB-054 [BLOCKED_BY BB-053] <- BB-053
BB-055 [BLOCKED_BY BB-054] <- BB-054
```

## Context semantics

```text
Task = scheduling / claim / execution unit
Component = context-routing unit
Worker = temporary owner of exactly one claimed Task
current.json = rebuildable TaskContext projection

Task
  -> components[]
  -> Component Registry / Context Profiles
  -> task artifacts
  -> direct dependencies
       DONE -> consolidated Living refs
  -> deterministic WorkerContext
  -> progressive search only for unresolved context
```

No task is selected by scanning artifact directories or repository history. Transitive dependency closure is derived from direct graph edges; it is not duplicated into task records.
